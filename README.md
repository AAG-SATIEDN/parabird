parabird
========

Parabird is a Python script for building a os independent [Linux, Windows and Mac OS] truecrypt encrypted usb-stick containing a portable version of thunderbird, enigmail, torbirdy and vidalia and a shared profile.

**NOTE:** The script is functional, but it is definitely in beta state. At the moment **GPG is not supported for Mac OS**. Give me a litte time to figure things out because it is also some kind of a python learning script for me. If you have some hints for solving our issues or any thunderbird tweaking tips, please get in touch.

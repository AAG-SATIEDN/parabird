Simple script written in python to build an os independent truecrypt encrypted usb-stick containing a portable thunderbird, enigmail, torbirdy and vidalia.

The script is not yet functional, it's pre-pre-pre-alpha. Give me a litte time to figure things out because it is also a python learning script for me.

There are some Depedencies:

* You should have truecrypt installed, it doesen't matter if it gui or console based, both versions should work.
* 7z will be needed for extracting the Windows Version of Thunderbird.

Depedency checks are done automatically. The Script should exit if any Dependency won't match.

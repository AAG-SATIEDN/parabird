Simple script written in python to build an os independent truecrypt encrypted usb-stick containing a portable thunderbird, enigmail, torbirdy and vidalia.

NOTE: The script is not yet functional, it's pre-pre-pre-alpha. Give me a litte time to figure things out because it is also a python learning script for me.

Requirements:

* USB-Stick with at least 4GB free space
* Internet Connection
* Linux based Host

There are some Depedencies:

* Python >= Python2.7
* You should have Truecrypt installed, it doesen't matter if it gui or console based, both versions should work.
* Mozilla uses 7z to pack Thunderbird for Windows, you'll need it for extracting. 

Depedency checks are done automatically. The Script should exit if any Dependency won't match.
